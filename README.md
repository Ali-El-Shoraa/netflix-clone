## Overview
I designed a Netflix-like website using HTML, SCSS, ReactJs, react-slick, and Firebase/Auth. The site includes an attractive and responsive user interface, and allows users to easily browse and watch a variety of digital content. Implemented authentication system using Firebase/Auth to provide a secure and reliable login experience.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
